## About

OK so PHP isn't really the most appropriate language for this. In fact it should probably be Ruby. And if it were in Ruby
then I should be using Jekyll instead. I started this because I wanted to write a small project from scratch - not using
any trendy framework, just pure coding and figuring out the best architecture.

This is really simple, aimed at geeks who want a simple blog with code samples and no whizzy things like their latest
hilarious tweets in a sidebar. And if you do, just do that with Javascript yeah?
