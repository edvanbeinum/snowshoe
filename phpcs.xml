    Here we are including a specific sniff but also changing
    the error message of a specific message inside the sniff.
    Note that the specific code for the message, which is
    CommentFound in this case, is defined by the sniff developer.
    You can display these codes by using the -s command line
    argument when checking a file.

    Also note that this message has a variable inside it,
    which is why it is important that sniffs use a printf style
    format for their error messages.

    We also drop the severity of this message from the
    default value (5) so that it is hidden by default. It can be
    displayed by setting the minimum severity on the PHP_CodeSniffer
    command line. This is great if you want to use some messages
    only in code reviews and not have them block code commits.

    <!--
    Here we change two messages from the same sniff. Note how the
    codes are slightly different because the sniff developer has
    defined both a MaxExceeded message and a TooLong message. In the
    case of this sniff, one is used for warnings and one is used
    for errors.
